# Abstraction-and-Encapsulation-Codes
A Python code that explores the idea of abstraction and encapsulation in an object-oriented-programming way. This repository is composed of three main codes with different functionalities.

## Programs
1. Fan Program
   - This program is designed to display, control and retrieve the different properties of the two fans such as speed, radius, color and power (on or off). It is written in an object-oriented programming way to optimize better organization.
3. Car Program
   - This program represents a car and initializes methods to display, control and retrieve the different properities of the car such as its year model, make and speed. It includes a function that displays the specific sequence of the car's acceleration and brake speed.
5. Pet Program
   - This program is designed to ask user for their pet's name, animal type, and age, and store these information as an attribute. These inputs will be printed or displayed on the terminal.
  
## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: ‘git@github.com:pororoarx/Abstraction-and-Encapsulation-Codes.git’
2. Go the repository's directory. It is composed of three folders and each program has its own designated folder. Run the main file in each folder.
3. Follow the instructions printed on the screen after running the program to observe the outputs.

## Formulation
This program is designed using python. Each function has used at least one unique function of the language program. It uses the concept of making instances of the class, for loops, etc. It also incorporates different color formatting to enhance readability of the output in the terminal.

## Conclusion
A Python code that is programmed to explore the idea of abstraction and encapsulation in an object-oriented-programming way.
